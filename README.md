Online Fracas
========================

Based on the open-source game named OpenFracas build in Ruby.

I started this project after I realized that javascript, html5 and modern browsers could make the same game that only a few years ago could not have been played in the browser. For many years I have enjoyed playing the game Fracas, and even did a partial port to c++ a long time ago; now I want to help this wonderful game by making it even more playable. The progress of this game might be slow at times because I have to do things in my outside life, but I hope eventually that this will be a fully playable, multi-player, online game.

There is a specification, and you can get an overview of what I am trying to do. But I wrote it more as a guide of what is going to be extra in the game besides open fracas, and does not cover the server side of things yet.
