Online Fracas
========================

Based on the open-source games Fracas and OpenFracas.

I started this project after I realized that javascript, html5 and modern browsers could make the same game that only a few years ago could not have been played in the browser. For many years I have enjoyed playing the game Fracas, and even did a partial port to c++ a long time ago; now I want to help this wonderful game by making it even more playable. The progress of this game might be slow at times because I have to do things in my outside life, but I hope eventually that this will be a fully playable, multi-player, online game.

There is a specification folder, and you can get an overview of what I am trying to do. The code can generate clickable maps, and the maps and games can be saved in the browser or exported. At this stage the game does little more than make maps, save them and load them.
